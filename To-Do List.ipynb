    "# To-Do List\n",
    "\n",
    "This Jupyter Notebook contains a simple To-Do List application. The application allows users to add, view, and remove tasks from their to-do list. It is designed to help users manage their tasks efficiently.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Features\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Add Task**: Allows users to add a new task to the to-do list.\n",
    "- **View Tasks**: Displays all the tasks in the to-do list.\n",
    "- **Mark Task as Done**: Allows users to mark a task as completed.\n",
    "- **Remove Task**: Allows users to remove a task from the to-do list by specifying the task number.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Example Usage\n",
    "\n",
    "To use the To-Do List application, simply run the cells in the notebook and follow the prompts to add, view, mark as done, or remove tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Example usage\n",
    "add_task('Buy groceries')\n",
    "add_task('Complete homework')\n",
    "view_tasks()\n",
    "mark_task_as_done(1)\n",
    "view_tasks()\n",
    "remove_task(1)\n",
    "view_tasks()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Code Explanation\n",
    "\n",
    "### Explanation\n",
    "\n",
    "- The `tasks` list stores all the tasks in the to-do list.\n",
    "- The `add_task` function adds a new task to the list and prints a confirmation message.\n",
    "- The `view_tasks` function displays all the tasks in the list. If the list is empty, it prints a message indicating that there are no tasks.\n",
    "- The `mark_task_as_done` function marks a task as completed by its number and prints a confirmation message. If the task number is invalid, it prints an error message.\n",
    "- The `remove_task` function removes a task from the list by its number and prints a confirmation message. If the task number is invalid, it prints an error message.\n",
    "- The `load_tasks` function loads tasks from a JSON file.\n",
    "- The `save_tasks` function saves tasks to a JSON file.\n",
    "- The `main` function provides a menu-driven interface for the user to interact with the to-do list.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "This To-Do List application is a simple yet effective tool for managing tasks. It provides a user-friendly interface and basic functionality to add, view, mark as done, and remove tasks. Feel free to modify and extend the code to add more features or improve its functionality.\n"
